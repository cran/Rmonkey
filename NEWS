# CHANGES TO Rmonkey 0.3 #

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES ##

* A new function, `surveyquestions()`, returns a named character vector of question wordings from a "sm_surveydetails" object. This can be useful for quickly mapping question IDs (which are used as variable names in `getresponses()` and `getallresponses()`) to original question wordings. (#11)
* A new function, `getallresponses()`, simplifies the process of creating a data.frame of all responses for a survey.
* Exposed a `...` argument to `httr::POST()`, etc.
* Transfered repository to the cloudyr project. (#9)
* Removed dependency on RCurl.

## BUG FIXES ##

* Fixed a bug in `as.data.frame.sm_response()` that caused surveys with certain question options to fail to bind as a data.frame. (#5, #10)
* Returned error messages on any API error rather than just "invalid request".
* Fixed a problem in `createsurvey()` (h/t Kevin Little, #7, #8)

## DOCUMENTATION ##

* Fixed an error in README example. (h/t Stephan Renatus)
